***Change log for bat-mon- the Fluxable battery monitor:

0.1.0: (early may 2016): The bat-mon script was cobled together, and tested run as a cronjob.

0.1.1: (mid May 2016): Rather crude .ogg sound alert files are created.

0.2.0: 23/05/2016- Systemd service and timer files now control the bat-mon script.
 This will be the first push to git, and hopefully we will have an AUR package today.

0.2.1: 28/06/2016- Systemd files are now designed to be run by the user and use the user's config file if it exists.
GUI notifications work now that the bat-mon script is run by normal users.

 
* ToDo:
Fix low battery test to keep running as long as we are below the low battery threshhold even when the battery is charging.
Add a simple configuration GUI.
