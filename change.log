***Change log for bat-mon- the Fluxable battery monitor:

0.1.0: (early may 2016): The bat-mon script was cobled together, and tested run as a cronjob.

0.1.1: (mid May 2016): Rather crude .ogg sound alert files are created.

0.2.0: 23/05/2016- Systemd service and timer files now control the bat-mon script.
 This will be the first push to git, and hopefully we will have an AUR package today.

0.2.1: 28/06/2016- Systemd files are now designed to be run by the user and use the user's config file if it exists.
GUI notifications work now that the bat-mon script is run by normal users.

0.2.2: 30/06/2016- Starter manpage added.
     icon is in package so we do not depend on someone elses icon.
     Logging improved a bit.
     Minor syntax improvements in main script.

 
* ToDo:
Fix low battery test to keep running as long as we are below the low battery threshhold even when the battery is charging., (seems to be working now)
Improve logging and keep a copy of log after shutdown.
Add a simple configuration GUI.
